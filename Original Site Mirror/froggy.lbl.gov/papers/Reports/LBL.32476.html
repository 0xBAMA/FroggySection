Sophisticated image-based applications have the potential to play an
important part in enhancing curriculum in a variety of disciplines,
both cultural and scientific, and in providing K-12
students with the involvement and motivation to learn  a wide variety
of computer skills.  An example of this is our ``Whole Frog'' project.
In this project the idea is two fold: First is to demonstrate the utility of
image based applications in biological sciences through a demonstration of
whole body, 3D imaging of anatomy as a curriculum tool; and second, to
introduce the concepts of computer based imaging and 3D geometry and visualization.<p>

The curriculum goal of the Whole Frog Project is to provide high school biology
classes the ability to
explore the anatomy of a frog by using data from high resolution MRI imaging and
mechanical sectioning, together
with 3D surface and volume rendering software
to visualize the anatomical
structures of the original animal. Ultimately we intend to be able to
``enter the heart and fly down blood vessels, poking our head out at
any point to see the structure of the surrounding anatomy''.
The secondary goal of this project is to introduce the concepts
of modeling and displaying 3D structures directly from 3D images obtained, for example,
from MRI imaging (biological specimens), X-ray CT imaging
(industrial imaging of non-biological
objects), and direct generation from mathematical descriptions.
Introducing this technology
requires training teachers and students in the concepts and tools of image acquisition,
enhancement, and analysis, and in the construction and manipulation of 3D
graphical representations.
<p>

The realization of the potential impact of this technology on students
grew out of our experience with undergraduate courses in computer
graphics and image processing.
The experimental study unit for biology was developed with the assistance
of several high school teachers,
and
during the summer of 1991 we conducted an experiment to
establish the parameters of a more extensive program. In this
experiment we used a computer science graduate student to train
two high school biology teachers in the use and concepts of the
computer systems and tools needed to image and visualize 3D objects
(initially an orange).
To introduce this technology we trained teachers in:<p>

<ul>
<li>The basic concepts and tools of image acquisition,
enhancement, and analysis;
<li>The concepts, construction, and manipulation of 3D geometric models
and their graphical visualizations;
<li>The Unix workstation environment that supports all of the necessary
computer applications.
</ul><p>

These
teachers were enthusiastic learners, and as they mastered the concepts
they suggested modifications in the material and techniques that will be needed to
introduce this material into the classroom.<p>

A next logical step will be
to develop material for summer workshops
to be held at LBL, and attended by both teachers and students. These
workshops will further develop the materials and techniques needed to
introduce advanced imaging technology into the
classroom.  The ultimate goal is to place high speed computer networks
and workstations in the schools in order to make this technology a part of the
regular curriculum.<p>

The whole frog project is an example of one class of exploratory imaging
applications, other examples of this 3D imaging and visualization
include a high resolution X-ray CT scan of
a small jet engine, and 3D confocal microscope images of large
uni-cellular organisms like Paramecium. Other classes of imaging
applications that we have proposed for involving advanced imaging,
computing, and networking technology in the secondary education system
include a ``digital darkroom'' project, on-line access to earth image
repositories (both the EROS Data Center and U. S. Sprint have
expressed interest in this), and on-line access to museum image
databases (for example U. C. Berkeley's Lowie Museum of Anthropology).
This capability has now been enabled by Moasic / WWW.
<p>

We are currently developing the technology to bring an optical
microscope on to the network in a way that permits remote control and manipulation,
and display of live video output from the microscope.

<p>

At the present time, the available material includes a study outline, numerous
images of the frog and several plants, the high resolution volume data sets
and 3D models for various internal structures of the objects that have been studied,
scripts and prescriptions for display and manipulation in several volume
rendering packages, a teacher produced MacroMind Director multimedia
frog anatomy sequence, and several movies (in the form of digital image sequences, some
of which have been transferred to video tape).<p>
