The success of 
this project indicates that the Web and its associated

<p><em>We utilize the Common Gateway Interface capability of

<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper describes work demonstrating the potential of 
the World Wide Web architecture to provide a uniform 
interface to high-performance computing applications. 
The back end computation can take place on as complex 
and powerful a distributed system as needed to support the 
information display on the front end. All of this is hidden 
from the user, and the front end is the same Web browser 
(e.g. Univ. of Illinois'
Mosaic,
or Netscape Communications
Corp.'s
Netscape
Navigator) used to access many 
other kinds of information.

<p>Use of the Web provides a platform-independent interface 
to applications. Browsers (Web front ends) are available 
for use with most common operating systems and window 
systems (UNIX, X-Windows, PC's, Mac's, etc.). The Web 
support of interactive input from browsers (via "forms") 
provides a significant subset of the functionality included 
in Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) such as X Windows 
"toolkits".

<p>The Web's design
(
<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
,
<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>
)
has proven very versatile, providing
for a variety of high-level functions. These include: 
(1) publishing research results from high-performance 
computing, including interactive exploration of the data 
and methods used; (2) support of education by providing 
access to activities that are too computationally expensive 
for most secondary school resources, and; (3) mechanisms 
for collaboration and sharing possibly scarce and expensive
remote experimental facilities.

<p>We have used scientific visualization as a sample high-performance
application for the development and demonstration
of Web capabilities to support front ends for 
distributed processes. We also hope to provide an example 
of ways that Web based user interfaces to scientific analysis
and simulation codes can be built.

<p>The use of visualization in conjunction with the Web 
means that end users of scientific visualization do not necessarily
require high-performance rendering systems at 
their location, and can use a variety of personal computers 
and workstations. One of the primary goals of the "Whole 
Frog" project is to enable K-12 students in particular to 
learn about and use scientific visualization (and frog anatomy),
and to find out about high-performance computing 
and networking.

<p>The problem that we have selected as representative of 
many kinds of scientific visualization is that of visualizing 
large, 3D scalar fields. The example data set is a finely 
sampled 3D colored grid of the volume of a frog. The data 
is characterized by having significant internal surfaces (the 
anatomical organ boundaries).

<p>In addition to exploring the interactive capabilities of the 
Web architecture, we are also presented with an interesting 
exercise in how to provide (experimentally) a computationally
intense service to a large number of users with 
resources that are simultaneously (and primarily) used for 
other purposes. For example, the experimental package 
being described here - the Virtual Dissection Kit - has 
been accessed by 50,000 different sites, in over 50 different
countries in the
<a href="clarif.html">past 7 months</a>. The generation of the 
nearly 200,000 rendered images satisfying these requests 
has been done on four or five large-ish Unix workstations 
on a non-interfering basis.

<p>The number of accesses to a WWW page (an individual 
Web document) used for publication or education can vary 
considerably, depending, for example, on how much 
media attention it is receiving at any particular moment. 
Unless access to a page is restricted, the HTTP server (the 
system that receives and processes requests from Web 
browsers) must be prepared to handle a potentially large 
number of accesses per minute. If a page's intended use is 
interactive visualization, then long waits for an image are 
not acceptable. Given these considerations, one of our 
principal design goals was to have all of the rendered 
images of the frog available in a few seconds, or less, after 
the user interaction.

<br>

<h2>2.  The Process of Visualization</h2>

<p>There are a variety of ways in which 3D scalar fields can 
arise in math, science, and many other fields. They are 
trivially generated by evaluating a 3D function on a grid - 
a process that can lead to complex data sets and visualizations
(see, for example
<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>
). 3D scalar fields also arise 
from various types of reconstruction problems that result 
in serial sections (e.g. tomography). In this case we 
obtained a data set from sectioning the body of a frog.

<p>Obtaining a 3D data set that represents the internal structures
of an animal starts with building a voxel data set 
(voxels are small cubes - the 3D equivalent of pixels) that 
can be used as input for surface and/or volume rendering 
software. Generation of this data set for a frog required 
mechanical sectioning: magnetic resonance imaging did 
not provide sufficient resolution, due to differences 
between mammalian and amphibian physiology. Each 125 
micron slice was photographed and digitized, thereby providing
a representation of the frog internals as roughly 
10,000,000 tiny volume elements. Subsequently, semi-
automatic segmentation (isolation and identification of 
structure boundaries) provided a "mask" representing each 
organ. The details of these techniques are available in the 
<a href="/papers/Reports/LBL.35331.html">
Whole Frog Technical Report</a>
<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>
.

<p>Visualization of 3D scalar fields is typically done by "volume
rendering" or "surface rendering." Volume rendering 
is a process that treats the voxels as transparent and counts 
up the contribution of all voxels in the line of sight. This 
type of visualization is computationally expensive, and 
works best with a display system supporting a very large 
color space (e.g. a 24 bit, RGB frame buffer). Surface rendering
treats contours as "real" surfaces (e.g. represented 
as a polygonal mesh) and renders these surfaces accord
ingly. The rendering process is much faster, color resolution
is not quite so critical, but the generation of the mesh 
representing the contour surface is still expensive. One of 
the optimizations in the Virtual Dissection Kit, in anticipation
of heavy use, is that the contours are pre-computed, 
leaving only the rendering of the 3D object for responding 
to interactive requests. (That is, multiple objects and a 
viewing angle can be selected via the Web interface.) The 
masks mentioned above are the first step in generating a 
contour surface representation. The masks are converted 
to the voxel lists that define a contour surface by enumer
ating its intersection with the volume. We use this representation
of the contour surface for rendering.

<p>This approach of fixing the contour surfaces is reasonable 
for visualizing a frog, but may not be reasonable for a 
mathematical function or real-world data set where the 
structure is not well defined or known in advance. There is 
no reason that a general contouring capability could not be 
added to the Dissection Kit - it is only a question of supporting
the computational load that such a capability 
would generate.

<p>Given the frog volume data and organ masks, an intermediary
list of voxels representing the frog was produced 
using the Dividing Cubes method
<a href="#ref6">[6]</a>
for 3D surface generation.
This method has been modified by using mask 
values instead of algorithmic thresholding to identify the 
voxels that will be utilized in the surface generation step. 
The modified Dividing Cubes algorithm is used separately 
on each organ mask, resulting in lists of voxels for each 
organ. The surface normal vectors (needed for computing 
he color of a voxel given its original color, and the view
ing angle and lighting conditions for the particular view
ing specified by the user interaction) are similarly pre-
generated and stored in this list.

<p>The resulting list contains approximately 450,000 - 3D 
points representing the surfaces of the frog organs. If an 
organ is not selected for viewing, its portion of the point 
list is skipped. Rendering, that is, producing a 2D image 
representing the projection onto the screen of the 3D 
objects that are selected for display, is straightforward by 
using a z-buffer for hidden surface removal
<a href="#ref7">[7]</a>.
The alternative
of rendering all images beforehand is not feasible 
due to the number of possible images (over a million when 
all possible views and all possible combinations of organs 
are taken into account).

<p>Images are compressed before being sent back to a user. 
Since a typical frog image contains a high proportion of 
constant background, especially if only a few organs are 
selected, the GIF method of encoding
<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>
used by the 
HTTP protocol typically provides a compression ratio of 
at least 4:1.

<p>Even with this form of compression the amount of image 
data to be sent can be up to 60 kilobytes, which takes 
about sixty seconds using a 9600 baud modem. With this 
in mind, a forms parameter on the Web page can be set to 
generate images of three different screen sizes (205 x 205, 
304 x 304, and 480 x 480) resulting in transmitted image 
files of 5 kilobytes for those with slower connections, up 
to 20 kilobytes for normal use, and up to 60 kilobytes for 
high quality.

<p>The use of point (voxel) primitives and previously generated
normals results in rapid image generation (one second 
or less for the standard-sized image using a typical Unix 
workstation as the rendering server) with a good level of 
detail. This approach, in combination with the image-size 
options, meets the requirements mentioned above for rapid 
turnaround between a forms submission and return of the 
viewable image.

<br>

<h2>3.  The WWW
<a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/forms.html">Forms</a>
Interface</h2>

<p>The Web provides mechanisms to allow links from one 
document to other text, audio, image and movie documents
residing anywhere on the Web. In addition, the 
"forms" capability provides such GUI features as text 
input, and checkboxes and menus for selection among 
enumerated choices. User interaction is also possible 
through clicking on images in the document (which 
returns the x and y location of the pointer in that image) 
providing the mechanism for functions such as rotation 
and graphical object selection. Taken together, these capabilities
are a powerful means of allowing interactive user 
input and data exploration.

<p>
<a href="/cgi-bin/dissect?en">Figure 1</a> shows the forms interface for the Virtual Dissection
Kit, with a rendered image of the frog. This interface 
provides three ways for the user to interactively control 
the graphical display and learn about frog anatomy: controlling
which organs (objects) are visible, controlling the 
angle from which to view the frog, and using a mode of 
interaction that brings up brief descriptions of the organs 
seen in the image. In Figure 1 the first two of these options 
have been exercised to produce the image. A separate 
<a href="/papers/WWW.94/paper.html">paper</a>
<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>
describes the "Virtual Dissection Kit's" interface 
in detail.

<p>A user sets forms parameters and then submits them to the 
HTTP server. The
<a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">Common Gateway Interface</a>
(CGI) provides a
means to run a program from the HTTP server that 
handles the forms submission, performs the appropriate 
action, such as rendering an image, and returns the result
ing document back to the client. This document can be 
anything that can be written in the Web's Hypertext Mark-
up Language (HTML).

<p>In the case of the Virtual Dissection Kit, the document 
returned gives the appearance of a screen in which the 
only change is in the "window" containing the image of 
the frog. This is accomplished by returning the HTML 
document creating the screen that appeared before form 
submission, updated with a pointer to the new rendered 
image, and with the latest form settings.

<p>As an example of the flexibility provided by forms, a 
menu setting in the Kit interface indicates to the CGI 
script that it should return a form document that is a translation
of the user interface into a different language (the 
Virtual Frog Dissection page is currently available in 
English, Spanish, French, Dutch, and German). A user can 
also click on an organ in the rendered frog image and discover
its name and function which are returned as text. In 
general, the provider of information and research results 
has wide leeway in allowing user interaction and exploration,
and in formulating a response, since documents can 
be generated on the fly.

<br>

<h2>4.  The Virtual Dissection Kit Architecture</h2>

<p>When a user submits a form from the client, the form settings
are passed over the network to the HTTP server, and 
then to a CGI script. The script parses the incoming data 
and sends the result to an already running process (server) 
on a different machine. The load on the HTTP server system
is minimal; most of the computation is performed on 
the rendering server.

<p>In the event of multiple accesses, the load is further spread 
out by having several (currently five in the case of the 
Frog Dissection Kit) different systems available for graphics
rendering. One of these systems is chosen at random to 
perform the rendering, which takes about a second for the 
standard image size. There has not been a noticeable 
impact on the performance of these systems, which are 
regularly used for other purposes by our group (during 
peak periods in December 1994, there were up to 12 
accesses per minute that caused image rendering).

<p>The rendering server generates an image from the data list 
representing the frog. The data list, consisting of points 
and associated surface normals, is about 5 megabytes. It is 
loaded once upon the instantiation of a rendering process, 
and is thus always mapped in memory.

<p>After the image is generated by the 3D rendering, it is GIF 
encoded and written to a temporary file. The CGI script 
rewrites the Web page with the new forms settings and the 
location of the image file in HTML format to standard out
put, where it is intercepted by the HTTP daemon and sent 
back to the client. Before writing the form settings out, the 
script checks to see if any of them have changed during 
the current invocation, as a result of rendering or other 
actions, and updates them as necessary.

<br>

<h2>5.  Conclusions</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web model provides a flexible and powerful
method for providing access to documents and data, 
and resources such as high-performance computing. The 
availability of Web browsers for the most common platforms
and the presence of the Web throughout the world 
ensure very wide dissemination of information.

<p>The ease of use of Web development tools has enabled the 
implementation of a distributed system such as the Virtual 
Dissection Kit as an information server. Computational 
resources are extended beyond the machine running the 
HTTP server by using Unix interprocess communication 
mechanisms for communication with rendering servers on 
other machines.

<p>The Virtual Dissection Kit is an example of how scientific 
visualization in particular can be made available over the 
Web. It provides a capability for students that typically 
would be too computationally expensive to provide at a 
school site. An alternative to the dissection of a real frog, 
it also adds new capabilities such as un-dissection. The 
spatial relationships of organs to each other are easily 
seen, in combinations that would not be realizable in a real 
dissection. Future plans include techniques to build movie 
sequences on the fly (based on user input) to better visualize
3D relationships among organs; a virtual cutting tool; 
and finding mirror sites in places such as Europe, where 
the connectivity to LBL is slow.

<p>Visualization using the Kit requires substantial use of 
computing power and memory resources. Providing this 
without causing an undue load on our site was made possible
by distributing the task between the HTTP server and 
the rendering server, and having a pool of machines available
for rendering. In general, a well-equipped facility can 
provide services such as the Kit on a non-interfering basis 
by spreading the load among several workstations. Powerful
workstations, and the capabilities such as visualization 
that they provide, can be made much more accessible to 
sites such as K-12 schools through use of the Web.

<p>Due to their typically heavy load, use of more powerful 
systems than high-end workstations for Web publication 
or education may not be feasible. However, the Web offers 
the potential for research collaborations using supercomputers
and large, scarce experimental facilities. In a collaboration
there are not nearly as many users, and access to 
resources can be limited to a research group through use of 
Web capabilities. An example of the use of the WWW for 
such a collaboration is the
<a href="http://www-itg.lbl.gov/BAGNet.html">Bay Area Gigabit Testbed</a>
<a href="#ref10">[10]</a>
, 
performing research into high-speed networks.
