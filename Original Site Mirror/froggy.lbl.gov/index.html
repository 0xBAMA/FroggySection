<a name="intro">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The DSD "Whole Frog" project is intended to introduce the concepts of
modern, computer based 3D visualization, and at the same time to
demonstrate the power of whole body, 3D imaging of anatomy as a
curriculum tool. The goal of the Whole Frog Project is to provide high
school biology classes the ability to explore the anatomy of a frog by
using data from high resolution MRI imaging and from mechanical
sectioning, together with 3D surface and volume rendering software to
visualize the anatomical structures of the intact animal. Ultimately we
intend to be able to "enter the heart and fly down blood vessels,
poking our head out at any point to see the structure of the
surrounding anatomy". A summary of this may be found in:
<a href="papers/Reports/LBL.32476.html">LBL "Whole Frog" Project Summary</a>.</p>


<a name="study">
<h2>Example study outline on 3D reconstruction</h2>

<p>The secondary goal of this project is to introduce the concepts of
modeling and displaying 3D structures directly from 3D images obtained,
for example, from MRI imaging (biological specimens), X-ray CT imaging
(industrial imaging of non-biological objects), and direct generation
from mathematical descriptions. This approach is being developed in
conjunction with summer programs involving high school teachers and
students. For more information see

<a href="papers/Reports/LBL.35329.html">Geometric Analysis, Visualization, and
Conceptualization of 3D Image Data</a>
.</p>

 
<a name="technique">
<h2>Technique for acquiring and processing the frog data</h2>

<p>For a variety of technical reasons relating to differences between
mammalian and amphibian physiology, the resolution of MRI images of a
frog were not good enough to clearly separate internal structures.
A high resolution data set was obtained by a mechanical
sectioning technique that gave sufficient resolution to see detail
down to the level of large nerves.
Examples of mechanical slice data:
<a href="images/whole.frog/frog.mechanical.jpg">
<img src="images/whole.frog/frog.mechanical.logo.gif"></a></p>

<p>For a report on the mechanical sectioning and associated data collection issues,
please see
<a href="papers/Reports/LBL.35331.html">Whole Frog Technical Report</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples of reconstructions of other organisms</h2>

<p>High resolution MRI studies of several plants were done as part of this project, with
an orange forming the basis of the 3D reconstruction study unit.

<a name="image_data">
<h2>Available image data</h2> 

<p>Two kinds of data are used in the 3D reconstructions: slice images (<a
href="images/whole.frog/s109.gif">example slice</a>),
and masks (<a href="images/whole.frog/skeleton.mask.109.gif">example mask</a>).
Slice images are a sequence of sections through the object of interest. These
slices may be obtained directly as in mechanical slicing, or by tomographic
reconstruction.  The masks are a geometric representation of objects of
interest and are obtained by "segmentation" of the images. (This can be done
manually, or using image processing techniques.)

<p>The following describes how to get all of the data that went into the
images and reconstructions illustrated in this document.</p>

<p>The "data" behind the 3D models (e.g. of the frog) are images of slices
through the original object, and "masks" that define various regions of
interest (anatomical systems, in the case of the frog).</p>

<h3>Monochrome slice images</h3>

<p>The
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/">slice image data</a>
are in two  different formats: "raw" (no header)
monochrome images with a file format: each pixel is an unsigned byte, and the
scan lines are stored row-wise. For each data set there is a file called *.hd
that describes the number and size of the images. The slice image files
contain all slices for a given organism.  For example, the frog slice image
data set is 470 x 500 x 1Byte x 136 images. So each 500 bytes from this
dataset represents one scan line of the slice image.</p>

<dt>
For example, using PBM:
<dt>
Get frame one: 
<dd>
<code>
rawtopgm 256 256 < tomato.data > frame1
</code>
<dt>
Get frames one to four into a single image:
<dd>
<code>
rawtopgm 256 1024 < tomato.data >frame1-4
</code>
<dt>
Get frame two (skip over all of frame one):
<dd>
<code>
rawtopgm -headerskip 65536 256 256 < tomato.data > frame2
</code>
<dt>
Get frame three (skip over frames one and two):
<dd>
<code>
rawtopgm -headerskip 131072 256 256 < tomato.data > frame3
</code>
<dt>
etc.


<h3>Color slice images of the frog</h3>

<p>This is the original data obtained by cryotome slicing of the frog. The
slices are available both for
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/tiff">individual viewing</a>
in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">TIFF</a>
format, using the TIFF LZW compression option (approximately 900K apiece),
and in bulk as a
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/color.images.zip">zip file</a> (~120 Mbytes).
</p>


<h3>MRI data</h3>

<a id="datalinks">
<p>The
<a href="images/orange/data">orange</a>,
<a href="images/tomato/data">tomato</a>,
<a href="images/pumpkin">pumpkin</a>,
and
<a href="images/rat">rat</a>
data are only available as MRI - the rat dataset is not high quality.</p>

<p>The
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/MRI/">MRI data</a>
corresponding to the section data for the frog is also
not of very high quality. (The
speculation is that iron pigments in the frog's skin interfere with the MRI.)

<p>Many of the MRI images (as the tomato is) may require normalization
or histogram equalization in order to "see" much in an image displayed on the
screen.  For example:</p>

<dd>
<code>
rawtopgm 256 1024 < tomato.data | pgmnorm | your_favorite_display_program
</code><br/>


<h3>Mask data</h3>

<p>The masks are available as
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/masks/animations">animated GIF's</a>
suitable for viewing, and as
<a href="images/whole.frog/data/masks/tiff">multi-page TIFF files</a>
suitable for downloading.  The TIFF files were created with the TIFF option
to LZW compress the mask data.
</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Some Sun rasterfile screen dumps of 3D reconstructions done by raycasting
are stored in "*.IMAGES.tar" under the
<a href="#datalinks">links</a>
given above.
