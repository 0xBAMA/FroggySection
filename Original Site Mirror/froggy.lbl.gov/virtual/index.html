<h2 align="center">Virtual Frog Dissection Kit</h2>

<p>NOTE:  Fluffy has gotten a <a href="changes.html">facelift</a>.</p>

This <a href="/awards.html">award-winning</a> interactive program is part
of the <a href="../">"Whole Frog" project</a>.  You can
interactively dissect a (digitized) frog named Fluffy, and play the 
<a href="game/">Virtual Frog Builder Game.</a>  The interactive Web pages are
available in a number of <a href="languages/">languages</a>.

Help and additional information available include a

<a href="overview.html">overview</a> of how the system works,
a <a href="/papers/WWW.94/paper.html">paper</a>
that was presented at WWW '94, and a
<a href="/papers/Compcon.95/paper.html">paper</a>
that was published in COMPCON '95.  For some other interesting frog and
biology-related pages, see

including how many times it has been accessed in different languages.</p>

<p>We welcome your
<a href="mailto:dwrobertson@lbl.gov">suggestions and comments</a>.  Comments
from teachers and students are especially welcome.  Please note, however, that
we are computer scientists, not biologists.  We will not be able to help you
with your homework (see 
<a href="/related.html">biology-related</a> information for help).  Also, we
don't know of any animals other than the frog that have a computer-graphics
based virtual dissection page.  We get frequent requests for this information.
If someone has done such a page for a fetal pig, cat, etc., we'd be interested
in hearing about it.</p>
