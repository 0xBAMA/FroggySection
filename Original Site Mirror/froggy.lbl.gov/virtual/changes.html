<h2 align="center">Changes</h2>

<p>The Whole Frog and Virtual Frog pages have been consolidated under
<a href="../">https://froggy.lbl.gov/</a>.
All non-statistics scripts have been combined into
the dissect script.  The tutorial portion is accessed via
<a href="/cgi-bin/dissect?tutorial0">
https://froggy.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/dissect?tutorial0</a>, and the game portion is
accessed via
<a href="https://froggy.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/dissect?game">
/cgi-bin/dissect?game</a>.</p>

<p>The default view of the frog is now the standard dissection view, with
the ventral (bottom) surface up, and the nose facing upward.</p>

<p>The rotation controls have been combined into a compass-like control 
above the frog image.  Clicking on an arrow turns the frog in that
general direction.  Clicking on the diamond in the middle flips the
frog.  The reset button has been moved above the frog image.  The
organ selection controls are now simulations of checkboxes, and clicking
on a checkbox immediately adds or subtracts that organ.  (At some
point in the future everything will be converted to use Javascript, PHP,
and CSS.)
The "Skin" controls have been condensed into a single organ setting.
"Cut away" is now the default for "Skin on".</p>

<p>Image file names are now better suited for caching.
This should result in a much more responsive frog.  Temporary files are
cached longer, and many form submits will not result in a call to the
rendering server.</p>

<p>There are now only two possible image sizes.  The default size
is 250x250, and the large size is 400x400.  The control to change
the size is to the upper right of the frog image ('+' maximizes, '-'
goes back to default size).

<h3>Frog Builder Game</h3>

<p>The process of adding a frog organ has been streamlined.  Clicking
on an organ checkbox to add an organ will turn that checkbox
to a red question mark.  Instead of having to re-check the organ every time
an unsuccessful play was made, the game remembers the previous attempt
until either a play is successful, at which point the checkbox will be
checked, or another organ is attempted.</p>
