This is the second frog used in the Whole Frog Project. Three sets of data
were produced with the MRI scans.  frog2ci.hips seemed to be the best,
and only this set of data was processed using HIPS filters to balance the 
contrast on the images.

This same frog was later sliced and a better data set is produced that showed
more detail of the frog.

frog2ci.hips --  is a spin echo data set
with 50 slices, inplane resolution of 0.5mm, slice thickness and 
separation of 1.0mm, TE = 33ms.

The individual slices are in the tiff directory.
